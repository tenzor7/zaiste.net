Last month I was supposed to attend a [Dublin-Poznań Startup
Bridge](http://bestconnected.enterprise-ireland.com/dublin-poznan-startup-bridge/)
meeting, but
I got stuck in Berlin instead. It seemed like an interesting event. I was
especially looking forward to a presentation from Bartek Gola. After having seen
his ‘International First, Poland Second’ presentation before, I was hoping for
some amusing insights about « Polish startups ».  Why I find the guy
entertaining you ask ? I like his aspiration and courage along with his dubious
theory about the industry.

As we all know, various Polish incubators, accelerators or so called VC funds
usually take two digits share in a startup at the very beginning, close to 50%,
sometimes even more. Just to put this into context, [Y
Combinator](http://ycombinator.com) takes between
2-10%.  Obviously, there is no such thing like Polish startup industry, it is
rather a convenient, but very dangerous generalization that has to be avoided.
Unfortunately, even though it is false, believers make it real.

If you happen to be a funding entity, you are in a direct competition with companies
like [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) or [HackFWD](http://hackfwd.com/).
You are and will be compared with the best ones.
If you look through the success stories, you will notice that a good Internet
investor pretty much equals to an excellent technical leader: Paul Graham, Marc
Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, just to name a few. If we stick to that example, and
we put the limelight on the majority of aspiring Polish leaders that want to shape
local startup ecosystem, we will immediately conclude that they lack the most
important knowledge: technical knowledge which, as a result, could lead to
valuable insights and reliable guidance. I’m not against business/marketing
guys, their role is pretty important, but not as leaders. Obviously, you might
have chatted with them about Clojure, why functional programming is great or why
big data is important, but unfortunately, they would rather read about it. It’s like
globetrotters and librarians, some things cannot be described, you must do them
on your own and you must do them quite excessively in order to claim any
expertise in the area.

This industry is different, it is about Internet - multi domain synergies should
be natural and easy to reach. Instead we have self-acclaimed leaders, running
incubators, accelerators, VC funds with almost no tech people. Business is about
being able to create synergies across different domains. Each potential
participant has its role, but some of these roles are more important than
others. Elsewhere we have [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) or
[Andreessen Horowitz](http://a16z.com/) led and managed by
great coders, amazing programmers or hackers. While in this part of world
biz/marketing guys have fancy names: all those directors, managing partners,
CEOs, etc.

The message of this post is that we should aim for international experience from
the beginning, and leave behind the average. Always think global and always
compare your potential partners with those who are the best in the industry.
Only marketing guys? Bad sign. No coders in the managing team? Very bad sign. No
international experience? Pretty bad sign. What Poland and Europe really need
for Internet ventures is less business mumbo-jumbo, and more leaders with
technical skills.

Indeed, we live in a global world now.
