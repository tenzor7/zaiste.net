[cURL][1] is a solid and simple tool that allows transferring data from and to any server with command line using various protocols including HTTP. This article is a short introduction on how to use cURL effectively along with some lesser known tricks.

## Interacting with protocols

Getting a HTML page from a server is as simple as putting a HTTP URL as first cURL argument.

```
λ curl http://www.nytimes.com
```

cURL makes a `GET` request to the specified URL and brings back the results into the command line. This output can be saved to a file using `-O` parameter (`-o` if you want to use your own name for the file).

```
λ curl -O http://www.google.com/logos/2012/end_of_the_mayan_calendar-993005-hp.jpg
```

Getting a file from a FTP server is also easy:

```
curl ftp://username:password@ftp.server:21/path/to/file.tar.gz
```

There are two handy parameters, especially useful for debugging:

 * `-i` or `--include` which puts headers data returned by the server in the output
 * `-v` or `--verbose` which includes in the output both, headers data sent to the server and returned by the server

## Sending data to the server

`-d` or `--data` parameter allows to specify data to send to the HTTP server. It simulates a form submission. Invoking cURL with this parameter will make a `POST` request (instead of default `GET`). cURL will set `Content-Type` as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` automatically. Multiple fields should be separated by `&` or specified with a separate `-d` parameter for each field.

```
λ curl -d 'name=zaiste' -d 'age=17' http://server/
λ curl -d 'user[name]=zaiste' http://server/
```

It is also possible to send data in JSON format. `Content-Type` has to be explicitly set to `application/json` as it is used by the server to decide how to handle the incoming data.

```
λ curl -d '{"user": {"name": "zaiste"}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://server/
```

For convenience, the data can be also read from a file or from the standard input:

```
λ curl -d @sample-data.txt http://server/widgets
λ curl -d @- http://server/widgets
{ "name": "Widget 1" }
^D
```

We could also specify the `Accept` header which is used to tell the server what content types we accept as a client. The server will respond with `Content-Type` that will inform us about the content type of the returned data. As a result, `Content-Type` header is used to specify the type of data being sent both, from and to the client.

## RESTful Interaction

cURL comes in handy when interacting with RESTful APIs. In the examples below, we will use RESTful API built [yesterday][2].

Let's start by creating a simple resource from a JSON. As mentioned earlier, `POST` request override default `GET` when using `-d` parameter.

```
λ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Widget 1", "desc":"This is widget 1", "amount":"17"}' \
  http://express-mongoose-coffee.herokuapp.com/widgets
{
  "__v": 0,
  "name": "Widget 1",
  "desc": "This is widget 1",
  "amount": 17,
  "_id": "50f2fcc18270670200000001",
  "created_at": "2012-11-10T21:26:07.333Z"
}
```

For a resource update we will specify `PUT` method with `-X` or `--request` parameter.

```
λ curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": "21"}' \
  http://express-mongoose-coffee.herokuapp.com/widgets/50f2fcc18270670200000001
```

It is also possible to simulate `PUT` method with `POST` by using a special `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header.

```
λ curl -H "X-HTTP-Method-Override: PUT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": "9999"}'  \
  http://express-mongoose-coffee.herokuapp.com/widgets/50f2fcc18270670200000001
```

Finally we can delete the resource using `DELETE` method.

```
λ curl -X DELETE  \
  http://express-mongoose-coffee.herokuapp.com/widgets/50f2fcc18270670200000001
```

Similar to `PUT`, we can ask the server to override a `POST` request if
setting `DELETE` explicitly is not possible.

```
λ curl -H "X-HTTP-Method-Override: DELETE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": "9999"}'  \
  http://express-mongoose-coffee.herokuapp.com/widgets/50f2fcc18270670200000001
```

## Login with Basic Auth

HTTP Basic authentication is a simple way to secure web pages. If SSL is not used, the credentials are passed in plain text. cURL has `-u|--user` option that allows to login using that method.

```
λ curl -u username:password http://server/
```

## Login with Cookie

cURL can be also used to login using a cookie. In the exampleb below, we simulate a form submission of login credentials, and we store returned cookies in a file with `-c` parameter. For following requests, we can then use that cookies (`-b` parameter) to authenticate. The process simulates how a browser handles the session.

```
λ curl -d "username=admin&password=admin" -c cookies http://server/login
λ curl -L -b cookies http://server/
```

Things may get a little tricker when [CSRF][3] validation is enabled. In such case it would be also necessary to extract CSRF token.
