      ## Let's talk
      I'm **Zaiste!** I help companies & brands **kick ass** in the digital realm by providing them with **cutting-edge** technology solutions. 

      I work at [Nukomeet](http://nukomeet.com), a guild of self managed digital experts that use cutting-edge technologies to build awesome applications. We are *different*, read our [Manifesto](http://nukomeet.com/blog/2012/can_we_hack_the_company_model/) to see why.
